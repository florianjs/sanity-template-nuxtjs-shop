# Toko - Sanity Starter template for Netlify powered by NuxtJS

**A Demo is available here : https://toko-sanity.netlify.app/**

Toko is an Open Source Jamstack e-commerce solution powered by NuxtJS (Front-End) and Sanity (CMS). Toko focuses on four key points: **Performances** to give users fast loading time, low data consumption to improve the **eco-conception**, **SEO-friendly** content, and **modern design** templates.

Toko is also mainly free to use, thanks to the Jamstack. You can deploy your front-end to Netlify and the CMS to Sanity for free. The only expense you'll need is probably a domain name ($10 / year), but this is optional.

Toko is perfect for people looking to focus on content creation and not technical and performance optimization. Once everything is deployed, set up, and customized, you can start selling right away!

**Features:**

- Stripe
- Responsive design
- Static
- Singleton Sanity Studio
- Choose your own color schema from Sanity Studio
- Dynamic homepage
- SEO optimized
